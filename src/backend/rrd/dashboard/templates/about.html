        <!-- Mission Statement -->
        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">At the Hazard and Climate Resilience Institute, we are committed to building a safer, stronger future for rural communities across the country. Our work centers around one core belief: resilience is not a luxury — it's a necessity.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Who We Are -->
        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Who We Are</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">We are a team of researchers, engineers, planners, and community advocates united by a shared passion for rural resilience. From small towns to farming regions to isolated mountain communities, we believe every community deserves the tools and support to thrive in the face of growing hazards and a changing climate.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What We Do -->
        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What We Do</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Rural areas face distinct challenges: limited access to critical resources, economic vulnerabilities, aging infrastructure, and geographic isolation. Understanding these unique needs, we adapted and evolved the City Resilience Index, a tool originally created for urban centers, into a framework specifically designed for rural communities.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Our work involves designing and conducting comprehensive resilience assessments — gathering critical data, analyzing vulnerabilities, and helping communities build clear, actionable plans for the future. It's a hands-on, collaborative process built around innovation, listening, and problem-solving.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Hazards such as floods, wildfires, droughts, and severe storms are increasing in frequency and intensity. For rural communities, the stakes are high. Yet many existing resilience tools overlook the unique realities of rural life. We saw a gap — and an opportunity — to make a difference.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Our mission is to provide communities with meaningful, easy-to-use data that leads to real-world action — not just reports on a shelf. We believe in empowering local leaders, organizations, and residents with the knowledge and resources to plan effectively, secure funding, and strengthen their communities for generations to come.</p>
